          <p>Like most people, I use my phone every day. It's the first thing I see in the morning and the last at night. I average about 5 hours of screen time, so I'm no casual user. Am I addicted? Yes, but can you blame me? If I didn't have my phone, I couldn't contact relatives and friends, and to be honest, I would be seen as entirely out of touch. I mean, even my grandma has a smartphone. However, my connection to my phone goes even deeper than your average grandma's. Since middle school, I've been obsessed with the latest tech. I would watch hours of YouTube videos about anything and everything tech related. This naturally evolved into more than just a hobby; I hope to one day work professionally in technology as a software developer. Since beginning college, technology has ingrained more into my life and, eventually, my future.</p>

          <p>Though most phones use complex hardware, the most memorable part of your daily interaction with a phone is through its software. Every phone has a mobile operating system that manages your phone's memory and processes. The operating system allows applications to live on your devices, like Instagram and Snapchat. This is the first of many layers of abstraction the user experiences when interacting with a smartphone. Developers, designers, and engineers work hard for the experience of using a phone to feel effortless, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Behind the scenes, thousands of lines of code and meticulous design choices have been made to simplify the experience for the user. When thinking of the point of view of a phone, you may think it sees you endlessly scrolling down social media or struggling to finish a level of Tetris. Still, in reality, a phone only receives a series of inputs and responds to a series of outputs. This means the most effective way of analyzing a phone is rather by thinking from the point of view of a multibillion-dollar corporation.</p>

          <p>The hardware of a telephone, when it was initially patented in 1876, was relatively simple. A phone consisted of a power source, a switch hook, a dialer, a ringer, a transmitter, a receiver, and an anti-sidetone circuit1. Even though a modern-day telephone may seem completely different than its 19th-century predecessor, all telephones still utilize these same mechanical components. Through the advancements in electronics, the archaic heavy hardware of the original phone has been replaced by microcircuitry that allows for a portable device. Even the modern-day iPhone utilizes all the original components of the actual transmission device. Combined with the advances in electronics, an iPhone uses software that transforms the original phone into a flexible device with many features. Though you may not see a rotary dial on your iPhone, you utilize a phone application that allows you to dial up your friends using a digital dialing system.

            <p>            The implementation of touch screen applications is really where the large tech companies were able to gain valuable insight into our daily lives. Extensive data collection has already been practiced for years by Google2. They reason that collecting data on their users allowed them to accommodate their needs better. Google representatives explained that every time they release a new design, they could analyze how users react and tweak the design accordingly. In recent years, concern has risen over the integrity of companies like Google. Though they may be utilizing our data for design implementation, they've also been known to sell it to other companies who can use it easily to target specific groups and manipulate their audience. These outside companies use this data to curate their advertisements to particular groups of people. This can become especially problematic when information is used to spread political agendas. A typical result of these flawless designs is the aesthetic usability effect3, which blinds users from underlying issues in the application they're interacting with. Most users are so amazed with the visual appeal of these new devices that considering security concerns and data manipulation goes over their head.

          <p>Telephones may have begun as a device solely used for human communication and evolved to include many technologies packed within a small package. Telephones transformed into full-fledged smartphones with a multitude of features. Throughout the years, culture has dramatically evolved to be smartphone dependent. This device so ingrained into our daily lives is simultaneously observing and documenting more about us than we've ever imagined. Society's addictive relationship with the evolved telephone has chained us to a never-ending cycle of inputs and outputs. At the same time, the device itself analyzes us for better ways to optimize this cycle.</p>
